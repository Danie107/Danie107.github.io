### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 

    Lab 1 was the easiest, yet a difficult lab I had done. I was not sure 
    where to go, where to put the code, and if I was doing them right. 
    It was the first stepping stone that I had to take and even then, 
    there were times I had to go back into lab 1 just to figure out how to 
    clone, test and push. 

* Lab 7 

    In Lab 7, I had to code about parking time and days. It was a lab that 
    I had the most difficult with because I was kept getting confused 
    with “&&” and “||”. But despite all the difficulties, it was a fun 
    experience because I was able to use what I learned in class into coding, 
    and I felt that I was improving in C++. 

* Lab 9 

    Lab 9 Part 1 was about spell checking. I think this lab was a lab where 
    I had to bring other text files into the code and make the computer read 
    it. I had so much trouble trying to bring the file and making the computer 
    read and detect the error, while trying to fix the errors. But I had a lot 
    to learn from the lab because of how practical it was.
